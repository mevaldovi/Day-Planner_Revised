# Agknowledgments
Special thanks to Trinh Nguyen for helping challenge me and point me in the right direction at the same time to complete this project.
Thanks also to classmate [Jacob Guiro](https://github.com/Jguiro09) for letting me use his jQuery for the last function in my script.js file.

"Last, but not least, I would like to thank me. I want to thank me for believing in me, I want to thank me for doing all this hard work. I wanna thank me for having no days off. I wanna thank me for never quitting. I wanna thank me for always been a giver and trying to give more than I receive. I want to thank me for trying to do more right than wrong. I want to thank me for just being me at all times.‚Äù --Snoop Dog
